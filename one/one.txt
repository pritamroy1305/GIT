Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase and collaborate with others..
With Git, developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once the work is complete, the changes can be merged back into the main branch. Git also allows for easy collaboration, as multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously and merge their changes seamlessly
